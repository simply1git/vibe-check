# Vibe Check Promotional Video Creative and Production Plan

This document aims to create a highly engaging AI-generated video short for the "Vibe Check" social web application.

## Part 1: In-Depth Research Summary

### 1.1 Core Values ​​and User Profile
*   **Value Proposition:** "More than just a party game, it's a test of soul resonance."
*   **Unique Selling Points (USP):**
*   **Zero-Friction:** No registration required, PIN code login, instant play.
*   **Privacy and Security:** Emphasizing "What happens in the vibe, stays in the vibe." 
*   **Dynamic Generation (AI-Powered):** Personalized questions based on member profiles, avoiding generic content.
*   **Visual Feast:** Dark Mode Neon style, appealing to Gen Z aesthetics.
*   **Target Audience:** Gen Z and Millennials. They crave authentic social connections, enjoy fast-paced, highly interactive, and meme-worthy content, are sensitive to privacy but also willing to share.

### 1.2 Video Marketing Trends and Psychology
*   **The 3-Second Rule:** The beginning must grab attention with visual impact or cognitive conflict ("Do you really know your best friend?").
*   **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** Showcase hilarious and shocking moments between friends, implying "If you don't play, you'll miss out on the secrets of this circle."
*   **Dopamine Visuals:** Use high-saturation neon colors (purple, pink, cyan), flowing light effects, and glitch art to stimulate visual pleasure, highly consistent with the app's UI style.

### 1.3 AI Video Generation Best Practices
*   **Tool Selection:** Recommended tools include **Runway Gen-2** (excels at stylized transitions and abstract lighting), **Pika Labs** (excels at object motion control), or **Sora** (if available, excels at long shots and complex narratives). *   **Prompt Engineering Techniques:**
*   **Style Consistency:** Repeat core style keywords in each prompt (e.g., "Cyberpunk neon lighting, cinematic 8k").
*   **Clear Subject:** AI struggles with complex multi-person interaction details; focus on "emotional close-ups," "macro views of phone screens," and "abstract imagery of connection." 
*   **Camera Movement Instructions:** Use professional cinematography terms (e.g., "Slow zoom in," "Rack focus," "Dynamic pan") to enhance the cinematic feel.

## Part Two: Video Planning and Creative Concept (Creative Brief)

### 2.1 Core Concept: "Frequency Alignment"
*   **Theme:** Finding people who are on the same wavelength as you in a noisy world.
*   **Emotional Tone:** Mystery -> Anticipation -> Celebration -> Close Connection.
*   **Visual Style:** **"Cyber-Social"**. Combining real-life scenes (dim party corners, campfire) with neon visualizations of the digital world (data streams, heartbeat ripples, crown icons).

### 2.2 Narrative Structure (30-second short film)
1.  **Hook (0-5s):** The feeling of alienation in the real world vs. the moment a phone screen lights up.
2.  **Demonstration (5-15s):** Finger tapping, swiping, questions popping up, neon light effects exploding.
3.  **Climax (15-25s):** Friends making eye contact, laughing, virtual crowns bouncing on their heads (ranking first).
4.  **CTA (25-30s):** "Check Your Vibe." Scan the QR code or visit the link.
